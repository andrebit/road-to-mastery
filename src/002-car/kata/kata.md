# Welcome to 002-car kata
## You're going to build a very very simple car.
This car has an engine, a gas tank, a key, four wheels, a brake and gas pedals.

- The car can only move if the key is turned on
- For every second the gas pedal is pressed then 1 unit of gas is burned from the tank
- The car can not move when there is no gasoline
- The car stops when the brake is pressed down and no gasoline is consumed
- The car can not move without its 4 wheels

This car also has

- a brand
- a chassis number
- a production year

The engine has

- an identification number
- a brand

## Restrictions for this challenge

- The only OOP construct you should use is a class
- No other OOP construct like inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces etc
- We will learn from evolving this example with improvements one step at a time building up our muscle memory
